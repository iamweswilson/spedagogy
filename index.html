                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                        Spedagogy is using research-based practice to improve how we deliver specially designed instruction and school-based therapeutic services. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        By creating a meaningful collaboration between administrators, educators, parents and service providers, teams then have the ability to work together on a shared platform to focus on the students and make sure no child is left behind (as well as no service provider). Spedagogy is an entire model built around workload. When a district or campus chooses to implement the Spedagogy model we help facilitate the discussions, establish a shared platform, identify and address barriers to success, support program implementation, and provide ongoing professional development. Utilizing a workload model, collaborative approaches, and evidence based practice, Spedagogy partners with districts to make sure every child receives the education they deserve within a system that optimizes their most valuable resources; their staff.
